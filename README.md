# Ing Case Study

## Project Overview

This is a frontend project built with Lit, a modern Web Components library.
It uses JavaScript (ESM) modules and leverages LitElement for creating lightweight, reusable custom elements. The project is styled with CSS modules and follows a modular component architecture.

It includes ESLint for code linting (configured for modern JavaScript and Web Components best practices) and integrates Husky for Git hooks, ensuring consistent commit messages and code quality enforcement through Commitlint.

For development workflow enhancements, it uses Lint-staged to lint staged files before committing.

The project structure is designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of integration in any framework or standalone application.
